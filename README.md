    - There are around 1,549 employees that are qualified for mentoring 90,398 employees. So each mentor need to handle 58~ next generation employees which
    is quite a difficult task. So Pewlett-Hackard needs to rethink about the mentorship eligibility criteria so that more employees can qualify for mentorship
    to handle large number of next generation employees.
